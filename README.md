## 🧠 Problem Statement

In real life, people often want to connect but hesitate because:

- Asking for a phone number feels awkward
- Sharing personal information upfront is risky
- Existing social apps rely on usernames, numbers, or public profiles
- There’s no simple way to connect **only with people nearby, in the moment**

---

## 💡 Solution

PASS introduces a **radar-based proximity system** where users can discover nearby PASS users and send connection requests **without revealing personal information**.

Connections only happen when **both users explicitly accept**, ensuring privacy, consent, and full user control.
