## Example Interaction Flow

A typical connection flow in PASS follows these steps:

1. A user opens the PASS application and becomes discoverable within an approximate proximity range (e.g., ~100 meters).
2. Nearby users within this range are surfaced without revealing personal identifiers or precise location data.
3. A connection request is initiated by one user.
4. The request is validated and securely routed through backend services.
5. The receiving user explicitly accepts or rejects the request.
6. Only upon mutual consent is limited profile data exchanged.
7. Proximity-related location signals used during the interaction are handled ephemerally and disposed after evaluation.
8. The connection can be revoked at any time by either party.
