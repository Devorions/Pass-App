## Example Interaction Flow

A typical connection flow in PASS follows these steps:

1. A user opens the PASS application and becomes discoverable based on proximity rules.
2. Nearby users are surfaced without revealing personal identifiers.
3. A connection request is initiated by one user.
4. The request is validated and securely routed through backend services.
5. The receiving user explicitly accepts or rejects the request.
6. Only upon mutual consent is limited profile data exchanged.
7. The connection can be revoked at any time by either party.
