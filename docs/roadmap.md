# PASS — Product Roadmap

This document outlines the high-level direction for the PASS platform.
It represents areas of focus and planned evolution rather than fixed timelines or commitments.

The roadmap is intentionally high-level and may evolve as the platform matures.

## Near-Term Focus

Areas of focus aimed at strengthening core functionality and usability:

- Improved connection request experience
- UX and performance optimizations
- Stability and reliability improvements
- Continued security hardening


## Long-Term Direction

Longer-term platform considerations and evolution:

## Roadmap Philosophy

PASS evolves based on three guiding principles:

1. User consent and privacy come first  
2. Security is built into every phase  
3. Features must support real-world, in-the-moment interactions  

This roadmap reflects direction, not deadlines.
